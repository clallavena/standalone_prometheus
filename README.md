This project was made during my internhsip of two year university diploma in IT (DUT), at Université Clermont Auvergne.

They are different directories:
**Scripts**: In this directory you will find the Bash and Perl scripts that allow you to install Prometheus with its components such as Grafana and AlertManager with a default configuration. You will find a README inside this directory that will explain you the good practice.

**grafana**: This directory contain different dashboard in JSON format for grafana. This is dashboard that i've made during my internship.

**promWansible**: This directory contain a full setup of Prometheus and its components using Ansible. This part of the project is thought for being generic. The README in this directory will give you the good practice and How it works.

**rules**: This directory contain some rules for Prometheus.

The script **Setup.sh** is related to the scripts, it's a installation setup that allow user to install what he want quickly.
